Summary

We are seeking a Senior Analytics Engineer or Senior Data Engineer to enhance our dbt + Airbyte pipelines by adding ZIP/geo enrichment capabilities. The ideal candidate will also be responsible for integrating this data into Tableau to create insightful heatmaps. A strong background in data engineering, ETL processes, and experience with visualization tools is essential. Your expertise will help us improve data accuracy and deliver actionable insights to our team. Join us in this exciting project to drive data-driven decision-making!

We’re a data team using Airbyte → Snowflake → dbt → Tableau. We need a senior data engineer/consultant to add ZIP code and other geographic enrichments to our existing pipeline and create geospatial heatmap visualizations in Tableau.

Key tasks:
• Design and implement geocoding/enrichment (zipcode → city, county, state, lat/long, census tract or others as required).
• Integrate enrichment into existing Airbyte ingestion or as dbt transformations (we’ll accept the best approach).
• Add GEOGRAPHY (Snowflake) columns and create dbt models (L1 staging + L2 transformations). Add dbt tests and docs.
• Implement Snowflake best practices for geospatial queries (clustering / search optimization suggestions).
• Build 2–3 Tableau density/heatmap dashboards and a reusable workbook template. Provide training & handover documentation.

Required skills: dbt (production experience), Snowflake (geospatial EXPERIENCE—GEOGRAPHY), Airbyte (or other ELT), Tableau (maps/heatmaps), SQL, and Git. Bonus: experience with geocoding APIs (Google / HERE / SmartyStreets / Census TIGER / open-source options).

Deliverables: design doc, updated Airbyte/config (if needed), dbt models + tests + docs, Snowflake schema updates, Tableau workbook(s), runbook and knowledge transfer session.

Access: we will provide a staging Snowflake role and a sample dataset. Contractor must keep credentials secure and work in staging first.

Please provide: 1) short proposal with approach, 2) estimated hours or fixed price per milestone, 3) links to relevant work or GitHub samples.
